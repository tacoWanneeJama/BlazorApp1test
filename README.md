# BlazorApp1test
This is a demo application for showing problems with expanding a datagrid row in combination with a custom filter.

I made this testing application with about the same problem:

When you expand the last row and change the filter, the expanded state of that row is NOT kept.
In my application this behaviour is for all rows, and not only the last row.
